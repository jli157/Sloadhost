Sloadhost v0.14

This is Free Software under the GPL v3, see file COPYING for complete details.

host = the computer sloadhost is running on.
target = the bootloader in the microcontroller sloadhost talks to.

build instructions:

tar -xvzf sloadhost-0.14.tar.gz
cd Sloadhost
cd Common
for Linux:  
	cp hostsystemlinux.h hostsystem.h
for Windows: 
	cp hostsystemwindows.h hostsystem.h 
cd ..
make

The code for specific bootloader targets is in the Protocols directory.  
Compiled executables from these are all put into the Bin directory.  
The naming convention for executables is:
sloadhost-targetname
like:  sloadhost-stm32

A completely separate, single executable is built for each target architecture.

There's no "make install" yet.. You can put the executables, or links to them,
wherever you like. 
 
The code that handles the host serial port is in the "Common" directory.

Build is currently switched between Linux or Windows by editing the file
Common/hostsystem.h.  You can change the desired host by changing into the "Common" directory and:
for Linux:  cp hostsystemlinux.h hostsystem.h
for Windows: cp hostsystemwindows.h hostsystem.h 

Windows code is working, but isn't as tested as the Linux side.
My environment on Windows is mingw: gcc 3.4.2 (mingw-special)
It may be rather old. 
My Windows is Windows XP Home Edition, v2002, SP2.

STM32 is the only supported protocol in this version.
